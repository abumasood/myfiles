## VirtualBox Virtual Machine (VM) Creation Scripts

The intent of these scripts is to expedite the creation of virtual machines by leveraging the commandline functionality of VirtualBox.

For an average user, creating a virtual machine using VirtualBox graphical interface requires a series of steps, including defining the VM specs and attaching the boot media. This process may be too slow for heavy VirtualBox users who have the need to creating VMs frequently, or large number of VMs (i.e. Beta-testers).

This page provides three scripts that should help accomplish the stated objective. The scenarios that these scripts cover are as follows:
1. Single VM creation
  * Create VM and start the VM
  * Create VM only (do not start VM)
2.  Multiple VMs Creation - the script will target a folder that has all the iso media files.

*For a comprehensive details on the commandline interface of VirtualBox, refer to [VirtualBox Manual](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-createvm).*
